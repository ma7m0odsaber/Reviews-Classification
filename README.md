**Project Title: Classification of IMDB Film Reviews Using Machine Learning**

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify film reviews as either positive or negative. Utilizing the IMDB dataset, which includes 50K text files split evenly into 25K text files for training and 25K text files for testing, the project aims to compare the performance of four different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

**Objectives:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for model training.
2. **Model Implementation:** Implement four different machine learning algorithms to classify the reviews:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Tree
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Compare the models based on their accuracy and training time.
4. **Tools and Libraries:** Utilize key tools such as Keras, Scikit-learn, Python, and Visual Studio Code to build and evaluate the models.

**Key Results:**
- **Logistic Regression:** Achieved 51% accuracy with a training time of 1 second.
- **Random Forest:** Achieved 84% accuracy with a training time of 257 seconds.
- **Decision Tree:** Achieved 70% accuracy with a training time of 400 seconds.
- **CNN:** Achieved the highest accuracy of 87% with a training time of 285 seconds.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **Keras Library:** Used for building and training the CNN model, providing a high-level API for easy model construction.
- **Scikit-learn Library:** Essential for implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms, as well as for pre-processing and evaluation metrics.
- **Python:** The backbone of the project, enabling seamless integration of various libraries and facilitating data manipulation and model development.
- **Visual Studio Code:** IDE of choice for coding, debugging, and collaboration, ensuring an efficient development environment.

**Conclusion:**
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning in sentiment analysis of film reviews. The CNN model showed the highest accuracy, indicating its potential for complex text classification tasks. This project highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm and tools for achieving optimal results in natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
